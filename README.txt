This is a program which creates an adjacency list and an array of distance structs in order to perform Dijkstra's algorithm.
In order to run the program you type ./compute.

This form of the program does not take in a file and has the edges and size hard coded in.  I am aware that this is 
not a good form of programming but it is what it currently is.
